I imported NumPy and Matplotlib to plot graphs and work with constants like π. The sine wave is defined using t and y. A time array t is created with np.linspace, spanning from 0 up to the chosen duration, with a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. The wave values y are calculated using the equation y = sin(2πft). For example, calling t, y = create_sine_wave(1, 2) generates a sine wave of frequency 1 Hz and duration 2 seconds. The function plt.plot is then used to draw the graph, labels are added to the x- and y-axes along with a title, and finally plt.show() displays the graph.
