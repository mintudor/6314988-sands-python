I imported NumPy and Matplotlib to plot graphs and work with constants like π. The project generates sine waves and step signals. A sine wave is defined using t and y. A time array t is created with np.linspace, spanning from 0 up to the chosen duration, with a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. The wave values y are calculated using the equation y = sin(2πft). For example, calling t, y = create_sine_wave(2, 2) generates a sine wave of frequency 2 Hz and duration 2 seconds. A step signal is generated using create_step_signal(duration), which produces an array y that is 1 for the first half of the duration and 0 for the second half. The functions time_shift and time_scale can modify these signals. For instance, t_shifted, y_shifted = time_shift(t, y, 0.5) shifts the sine wave by 0.5 seconds, and t_scaled, y_scaled = time_scale(t_step, y_step, 0.5) compresses the step signal in time by a factor of 0.5. The plt.plot function is used to draw the graphs, with labels on the x- and y-axes and titles for each subplot. Finally, plt.show() displays the graphs, showing both the original and modified signals. The project also includes tests using pytest to verify that each function behaves correctly, checking that sine waves and step signals are generated properly and that the time shift and scaling operations produce the expected results.
